# Description
This is a small Blazor Server project with Entity Framework for database work and MudBlazor as component library. The purpose of this application is to keep track of your kitchen inventory, to save both the enviroment as well as your wallet. It is worth noting that this application is meant to be run on a tablet (or similiar) with a barcode scanner for the best user experience in the kitchen.

The application is built on locations, categories, articles and stocks. You add each location you store food/consumables (for example fridge, freezer & pantry). You then add all relevant categories (for example grains, meats, fish, alcohol etc). Then you have to add every article that you have or will be storing, an article has a name*, a description (optional), a barcode/EAN (optional) and at least one category. 
When an article is specified, and you have at least one location added, you can add a stock, this is done by selecting the article (by scanning the barcode, or searching/selecting it in the autocomplete input), specifying the quantity of the article, the location of the article, and at last the best before date.

The stock will then be shown in a table sorted by best before date, and the best before date will be red if the stock is old, orange if it's almost old (within three days). You can also edit stock, where you can change its location, the percentage left of the stock (0-100%), and the best before date.


# DataBase
The five tables in the database were generated by EntityFramework (code first approach), from these follwing models:
- ArticleModel
- CategoryModel
- LocationModel
- StockModel
  
Where the fifth table is a table of ArticleModelId and CategoryModelId (as an ArticleModel can have multiple CategoryModels)

Triggers were added for each table (except the ArticleModelId-CategoryModelId table), a trigger for CreateDate and a trigger for UpdateDate, which is also specified in the DbContext.

Shows a table of all existing stock, sorted by best before date. The table rows contain the Id of the stock, the article name, all article categories, the location name, best before date (red if old, orange if old within three days), percentage left of the stock, as well as create date and update date of the stock. And two buttons, one for editing the existing stock, and one for removing the stock.

The user scans an articles EAN/barcode in the first text input, or chooses the article in the AutoComplete box to the right (useful for articles without a barcode, for example fruits and vegetables). The user then edits the quantity if needed, and set the location and best before date before clicking add. The stock is then visible in the table.
