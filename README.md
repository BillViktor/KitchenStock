# Description
This is a small Blazor Server project with Entity Framework for database work and MudBlazor as component library. The purpose of this application is to keep track of your kitchen inventory, to save both the enviroment as well as your wallet. It is worth noting that this application is meant to be run on a tablet (or similiar) with a barcode scanner for the best user experience in the kitchen. The application also supports Shopping List and a Recipe book. As well as suggestions for recipes based on your kitchen inventory.

The application is built on locations, categories, articles and stocks (and optionally ingredients & recipes). You add each location you store food/consumables (for example fridge, freezer & pantry). You then add all relevant categories (for example grains, meats, fish, alcohol etc). Then you have to add every article that you have or will be storing, an article has a name*, a description (optional), a barcode/EAN (optional) and at least one category. 
When an article is specified, and you have at least one location added, you can add a stock, this is done by selecting the article (by scanning the barcode, or searching/selecting it in the autocomplete input), specifying the quantity of the article, the location of the article, and at last the best before date.

The stock will then be shown in a table sorted by best before date, and the best before date will be red if the stock is old, orange if it's almost old (within three days). You can also edit stock, where you can change its location, the percentage left of the stock (0-100%), and the best before date. All Stock transactions are logged.

When adding a recipe, you must first add ingredients. You can then associate an article with an ingredient. You can also specify the nutritional values of an ingredient to get nutritional values per portion on your recipes. As well as use Suggestions, to get suggestions for recipes you can make with the stock of articles you have. When viewing a recipe, there's functionality to automatically remove/update stock required for the recipe. The stock used will always be sorted by opened stock, and then best before date of the stock.


# DataBase
The 10 tables in the database were generated by EntityFramework (code first approach), from these follwing models:
- ArticleModel
- CategoryModel
- IngredientModel
- LocationModel
- RecipeModel
- ShoppingModel
- StockModel
- StockLogModel
  
Where the 9th and 10th table is a table of ArticleModelId + CategoryModelId (as an ArticleModel can have multiple CategoryModels) and IngredientModelId + RecipeId.

Triggers were added for each table (except the 9th and 10th table) for setting UpdateDate to the current date of updating the post.

The user scans an articles EAN/barcode in the first text input, or chooses the article in the AutoComplete box to the right (useful for articles without a barcode, for example fruits and vegetables). The user then edits the quantity if needed, and set the location and best before date before clicking add. The stock is then visible in the table.
